# About

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a **Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity** and a **Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT)** certification from TCM Security. As the **captain of my CTF team**, I led us to secure **40th place globally** in the BlackHat MEA CTF—an event that set a Guinness World Record for the largest onsite CTF in the world.

My passion for infosec grew during my university years, where I gained expertise in penetration testing, web application security, and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. I actively use tools such as **Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit** to sharpen my offensive security skills and solve real-world challenges.

This blog is my platform to give back to the infosec community by sharing detailed write-ups, practical tutorials, and insights from ethical hacking on authorized systems. I focus on creating **beginner-friendly content** to help others master cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of safeguarding systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. Its foundation lies in ensuring the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of digital assets against evolving threats.

## Goals of This Blog

The main goals of this blog are:

* To teach and simplify cybersecurity and its related domains,
* To showcase my journey and professional expertise, and
* To contribute meaningfully to the infosec community.

This space is dedicated to **open, freely accessible knowledge**—ensuring it remains available even if attempts are made to block or censor it. By breaking down complex topics into practical, easy-to-understand insights, I aim to empower both learners and professionals in the cybersecurity field.

## Why This Matters

In a digital world where threats are constant, **cybersecurity education is essential**. This blog reflects my commitment to sparking curiosity, building resilience, and giving back to the infosec community through **open collaboration and shared knowledge**.
