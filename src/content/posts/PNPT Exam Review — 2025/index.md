# I Passed the PNPT Certification on My First Attempt

> Hello, I passed the Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification on my first attempt.

In this post, I’ll cover key aspects of my PNPT journey — including preparation, exam experience, tips that helped me succeed, and a few lessons learned along the way. If you’re planning to take the PNPT or just curious about it, this write-up should give you a solid overview.

## Background

The PNPT exam simulates a real-world penetration test. Unlike traditional CTF-style exams that focus on capturing flags, the PNPT requires you to perform realistic activities such as OSINT, external/internal enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.

After compromising the network, you must submit a professional penetration testing report. The report should include CVSS scores for all vulnerabilities along with remediation steps and references. Many fail this part due to inadequate reporting rather than technical shortcomings.

Finally, you’re required to deliver a live debrief session. I prepared a PowerPoint presentation to walk through my findings, but presenting your report directly is also encouraged.



## Whoami?

I’m currently an undergraduate student in my 8th semester. Over the past 3 years, I’ve been self-studying penetration testing and ethical hacking.

I began with TryHackMe, reaching the Top 1% globally. I later specialized in web application security via PortSwigger’s Web Security Academy, where I currently rank #67. I also train regularly on Hack The Box and participate in CTFs, often developing web challenges for competitions as well.



## Why I Chose PNPT

I chose the PNPT because it reflects real-world pentesting. The exam doesn’t test memorization or isolated challenges. It evaluates your ability to handle full-scope engagements from reconnaissance to reporting and client communication — skills essential for any professional penetration tester.



## Preparation

PNPT includes access to five comprehensive courses, all of which come with labs and real-world scenarios:

- **Practical Ethical Hacking (PEH)**
- **Windows Privilege Escalation**
- **Linux Privilege Escalation**
- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals**
- **External Pentest Playbook**

While the PEH course alone is sufficient to pass the exam, I went through all five and highly recommend doing so. Each course complements the other and builds a well-rounded skill set.

Additionally, I practiced enumeration, privilege escalation, and lateral movement on Hack The Box, and set up my own Active Directory lab to understand internal networks better.



## Tips

Here are some tips that helped me pass the PNPT on my first attempt:

**1. Don’t Overcomplicate It**  
Stick to the basics. Enumeration and a logical, methodical approach often yield better results than jumping to exploits too quickly. Always validate assumptions.

**2. Use Breaks Strategically**  
Avoid burnout by working in focused sprints and taking regular breaks. If you're stuck, walking away and returning with a fresh perspective can make all the difference.

**3. Log Everything From the Start**  
Start documenting early. Take notes and screenshots while progressing through the environment. This will save time when writing your report and ensure accuracy.

**4. Take a Step Back When Needed**  
If you find yourself stuck in a loop, take a break or switch tasks. Sometimes a small mental reset is all it takes to notice something obvious.

**5. Master the Tools You Use**  
Be fluent with essential tools like `nmap`, `NetExec`, and others. Understanding their full range of options helps you adapt during the exam without wasting time troubleshooting.

**Bonus Tip**  
Test your exam setup ahead of time. I had issues with NetExec on a VM and had to switch images mid-exam. Verifying tool compatibility beforehand avoids unnecessary stress during the assessment.



## Conclusion

The PNPT is one of the most realistic penetration testing certifications available. It goes beyond technical skills and tests your ability to think, document, and present like a professional.

The training content is excellent, and the exam feels like a real engagement. If you're considering the PNPT, I highly recommend completing all provided courses, practicing your documentation skills, and treating the debrief like a client presentation.

It’s not just about passing — it’s about developing the mindset of a real-world pentester.
