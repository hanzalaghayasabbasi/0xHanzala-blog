# About

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity and a **Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT)** certification from TCM Security. As part of a team, I helped secure **40th place globally** in the BlackHat MEA CTF, which set a Guinness World Record for the largest onsite CTF in the world. My passion for infosec grew during my university years, where I developed expertise in penetration testing, web application security, and actively participated in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges using tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit.

This blog is my platform to contribute to the infosec community by sharing detailed write-ups, practical tutorials, and insights from ethical hacking on authorized systems. I focus on creating beginner-friendly content to help others master cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets in a world of evolving threats.

## Goals of This Blog

The tertiary goals of my web site are:

- To teach about cybersecurity and any of its related domains,
- To use this as a platform to advertise who I am, and
- To contribute; give something back to the infosec community.

This blog is a dedicated space to share cybersecurity knowledge freely, ensuring it remains accessible even if attempts are made to block or censor my content in the future. By simplifying complex topics and sharing practical insights, I aim to empower learners and professionals in the infosec field.
